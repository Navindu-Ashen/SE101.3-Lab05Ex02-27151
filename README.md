Create an interface called "Shape" with two abstract methods: "double calculate Area()" and "double calculatePerimeter()". Implement the "Shape" interface in three classes: "Circle", "Rectangle", and "Triangle". Each class should have private instance variables relevant to its shape, and provide public getter and setter methods for these variables. Additionally, each class should define a constructor that initializes the instance variables. Write the implementation code for the "Shape" interface, the getter and setter methods in each class, and the constructors in cach class.
